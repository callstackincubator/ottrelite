## Creating a backend

TODO: write this section.

## Development

To start developing, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/callstackincubator/ReactNativeOttrelite
```

Then, install the dependencies & generate the glue code using Nitro Modules:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Any time you change the Nitro spec files (TS), run `pnpm run build` to regenerate the glue code.

### iOS - additional setup

For iOS, you need to install the CocoaPods dependencies. Run the following command in the `ios` directory of your project:

```bash
pnpm pod:install
```
