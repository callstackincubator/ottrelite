## React Native Internals Autoinstrumentation - enable RN Systrace for JS & Java/Kotlin

#### JavaScript

This package has opt-in options to revive the [RN Systrace API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/systrace), which is a simple JS API for tracing synchronous, asynchronous & counter events in your application. By default it's importable, but it's a no-op. Ottrelite can inject proper globals to make it functional and pipe the calls to [Ottrelite's Development API](#development-api).

To activate it, set `reviveSystraceAPI: true` in the optional configuration object passed to `Ottrelite.install`, as presented in the code extract in section [Development API](#development-api).

On both iOS and Android, the revived Systrace API will cause JS internals that are instrumented in RN source code to be traced, such as the `require()`s for modules required first time in a run.

On Android, this feature is much more powerful, enabling tracing of RN Android native source internals in places where RN's instrumentation has already been present.

#### Java/Kotlin
