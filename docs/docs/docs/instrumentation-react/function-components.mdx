# Function components

> [!NOTE]
> As seen in the examples below, the components are wrapped in `memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. This is a common practice in React to optimize performance, but it is not compulsory - the instrumentation would still work without it. However, in such case, it would be expected that most likely the instrumentation would produce many entries, for invocations of the component which didn't actually result in an update to the shadow tree.

```typescript
export const MyComponent = memo(function MyComponent(){
    "use trace";

    ...

    return ...;
});
```

Without memoization (be warned as per the notice above):

```typescript
export const MyComponent = function() {
    "use trace";

    ...

    return ...;
};
```

_Note: arrow function components are supported as well._

With an explicit Tracer name:

> [!NOTE]
> The name of the tracer is used to create a unique OTEL tracer, so make sure it is unique across your application.

```typescript
export const MyComponent = memo(function MyComponent(){
    "use trace TestLibMyComponent";

    ...

    return ...;
});
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please keep in mind that when using the `memo` helper (which is highly encouraged!), the name of the function will not be propagated from the assigned-to variable. For instance, the following code:
>
> ```typescript
> export const MyComponent = memo(function(){
>     "use trace";
>
>     ...
>
>     return ...;
> });
> ```
>
> Would result in an **error**, since the Babel plugin would not know the name of the component; for this reason, you need to either make the function a named function, or add an explicit name to the `"use trace Name"` directive.

## What will be the name of the tracer?

| Declaration style                                   | Name                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| _Explicit name from the string after `"use trace"`_ | The passed string                        |
| named function                                      | Name of the function                     |
| arrow function                                      | Name of the assignment target identifier |
| anonymous function                                  | Name of the assignment target identifier |
