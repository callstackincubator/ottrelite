# Quick Start

Get up and running with Ottrelite in just a few minutes. Ottrelite needs two components to work: a **tracing API** and a **visualization backend**.

## Prerequisites

Ottrelite requires `react-native-nitro-modules` to be installed in your project. If you don't have it yet, install it first:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@rspress/core/theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="install react-native-nitro-modules" />

For detailed setup instructions, consult the [react-native-nitro-modules documentation](https://nitro.margelo.com).

## Step 1: Install the Tracing API

Install the core Ottrelite package:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @ottrelite/core" />

Add a sample trace anywhere in your app to test the setup:

```typescript
import { Ottrelite } from '@ottrelite/core';

// Wrap any code you want to measure
Ottrelite.beginEvent('MyEvent');
// ... do some work ...
Ottrelite.endEvent();
```

## Step 2: Install a Visualization Backend

Choose a backend to visualize your traces. For this quick start, we'll use the Platform backend, which integrates with Android Studio Profiler and Xcode Instruments.

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @ottrelite/backend-platform" />

Configure Ottrelite to use the backend:

```typescript
import { Ottrelite } from '@ottrelite/core';
import { OttreliteBackendPlatform } from '@ottrelite/backend-platform';

Ottrelite.install([OttreliteBackendPlatform]);
```

:::tip
You can install multiple backends simultaneously to get different perspectives on your app's performance:

```typescript
Ottrelite.install([
  OttreliteBackendPlatform,
  OttreliteBackendTracy
]);
```
:::

## Step 3: Record and View Traces

Each backend provides different ways to record and view traces:

### Android Studio Profiler
1. Open your project in Android Studio
2. Run your React Native app
3. Open the Profiler tab (View → Tool Windows → Profiler)
4. Start a CPU recording session
5. Trigger the code with your traces
6. Stop recording and view the traces

### Xcode Instruments
1. Build and run your iOS app
2. Open Instruments (Xcode → Open Developer Tool → Instruments)
3. Choose the "os_signpost" instrument
4. Start recording and trigger your traced code
5. View the hierarchical traces with timing information

:::note
For detailed backend-specific instructions, consult the individual backend documentation in the [Backends](./backends/introduction.mdx) section.
:::

:::tip
For real-time profiling, consider using the Tracy backend. Unlike Android Studio Profiler and Xcode Instruments, Tracy is a real-time profiler that can give you a frame-by-frame analysis of your app's performance without having to wait for the trace to be recorded.

## Next Steps

Now that you have basic tracing working:

- **[Learn about tracing methods](./core/introduction.mdx)** - Explore synchronous, asynchronous, and counter events
- **[Trace React components](./instrumentation-react/introduction.mdx)** - Automatically instrument component lifecycle
- **[Explore available backends](./backends/introduction.mdx)** - Try Tracy for real-time profiling or OpenTelemetry integration
- **[Explore OpenTelemetry integration](./interop-otel/introduction.mdx)** - Visualize your existing OpenTelemetry setup with Ottrelite's backends
